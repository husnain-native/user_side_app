# GoogleSignIn API Fix TODO List

## Issues to Fix:
- [ ] The class 'GoogleSignIn' doesn't have an unnamed constructor
- [ ] The method 'signIn' isn't defined for the type 'GoogleSignIn'
- [ ] The method 'standard' isn't defined for the type 'GoogleSignIn'
- [ ] The getter 'accessToken' isn't defined for the type 'GoogleSignInAuthentication'

## Steps to Complete:
1. [ ] Clean Flutter project cache
2. [ ] Update dependencies with `flutter pub get`
3. [ ] Verify GoogleSignIn usage in auth_service.dart
4. [ ] Test Google Sign-In functionality
5. [ ] Fix any remaining API usage issues

## Route Generation Fix:
- [x] Added missing route for `/AddEditPropertyScreen` in main.dart
- [x] Added import for AddEditPropertyScreen
- [x] Verified PropertyDetailScreen navigation works correctly

## Navigation Enhancement:
- [x] Added greater than icon (chevron_right) to property explore screen app bar
- [x] Added navigation from explore screen to my listings screen
- [x] Added route for `/my_listings` in main.dart
- [x] Added import for MyListingsScreen

## Stream Subscription Fix:
- [x] Fixed "setState() called after dispose()" error in RequestsScreen
- [x] Added StreamSubscription variable to store Firebase stream subscription
- [x] Added proper dispose() method to cancel subscription
- [x] Added mounted checks before calling setState() in stream listeners
- [x] Added dart:async import for StreamSubscription

## Current Status:
- GoogleSignIn usage in auth_service.dart appears correct for google_sign_in ^7.1.1
- No usage of GoogleSignIn.standard found in codebase
- Code uses proper constructor, signIn() method, and accessToken getter
