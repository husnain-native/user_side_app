# Firebase Setup for Park Chat App

## Overview
This project has been configured with Firebase Authentication for user signup and login functionality.

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. Firebase Initialization
- Firebase Core is initialized in `main.dart`
- Firebase options configuration file created (`lib/firebase_options.dart`)
- Auth state management with `AuthWrapper` widget

### 2. Authentication Service
- Created `AuthService` class in `lib/core/services/auth_service.dart`
- Handles email/password signup and signin
- Includes error handling for Firebase Auth exceptions
- Supports password reset functionality

### 3. Authentication Screens Integration
- Updated `SignUpScreen` to use Firebase Auth
- Updated `LoginScreen` to use Firebase Auth
- Added loading states and error handling
- Password visibility toggle
- Form validation with Firebase Auth integration
- Forgot password functionality

### 4. Authentication State Management
- `AuthWrapper` widget automatically redirects users based on auth state
- Authenticated users go to `HomeScreen`
- Unauthenticated users see `LoginScreen`
- User information displayed in app drawer
- Logout functionality with confirmation dialog

## Required Configuration

### 1. Update Firebase Configuration
Currently, the app is using the default Firebase initialization which reads from `google-services.json` for Android. For proper configuration:

**Option A: Use FlutterFire CLI (Recommended)**
1. Install FlutterFire CLI: `dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli`
2. Run: `flutterfire configure`
3. This will automatically generate the correct `firebase_options.dart` file

**Option B: Manual Configuration**
1. Go to your Firebase Console
2. Select your project
3. Go to Project Settings
4. Add your Android/iOS apps if not already added
5. Download the configuration files
6. Update the values in `firebase_options.dart` with your actual values

### 2. Android Configuration
- `google-services.json` is already in place
- Make sure your Android app is registered in Firebase Console

### 3. iOS Configuration (if needed)
- Add `GoogleService-Info.plist` to your iOS project
- Update iOS bundle ID in Firebase Console

## Features Implemented

- Facebook Sign-In button (shows "coming soon" message)

### ðŸ”’ Security Features
- Password visibility toggle
- Form validation
- Firebase Auth error handling
- Authentication state management

## Next Steps

1. **Update Firebase Configuration**: Replace placeholder values in `firebase_options.dart`
2. **Test Authentication**: Try creating a new account and logging in
3. **Add Social Auth**: Implement Google and Facebook authentication
4. **Add User Profile**: Store additional user data in Firestore
5. **Test Logout Functionality**: Test the logout button in the app drawer

## Testing

To test the Firebase integration:

1. Run the app
2. Fill out the signup form and create an account
3. Log out and test the login functionality
4. Test the forgot password feature
5. Test the logout functionality from the app drawer
6. Check Firebase Console to see the new user
7. Verify authentication state changes

### Firebase Test Widget
You can also use the `FirebaseTestWidget` to verify Firebase status:
- Shows if Firebase is properly initialized
- Shows current user authentication status
- Helps diagnose any Firebase issues

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Firebase not initialized**: Check `main.dart` for proper initialization
2. **Duplicate Firebase App error**: The app now handles this gracefully
3. **Configuration errors**: Verify `google-services.json` is in the correct location
4. **Network issues**: Ensure internet connection for Firebase operations
5. **Android build issues**: Check `google-services.json` is in the correct location

### Normal Development Warnings:
- **reCAPTCHA warnings**: These are normal in development and don't affect functionality
- **App Check warnings**: These are normal in development and don't affect functionality
- **Firebase Locale warnings**: These are normal and don't affect functionality

### Error Messages:
- "An account already exists for that email" - User already registered
- "The password provided is too weak" - Password doesn't meet Firebase requirements
- "The email address is invalid" - Email format is incorrect
